    subtitle: " Now let’s discuss about the system, if someone meets\r with a road accident and became unconscious, so that the person/persons in\r the car cannot contact emergency services, then our alert system comes into\rthe picture. There will be a device which is connected to the OBD port in the\r car and there is also a mobile application which is connected to the device. If\r the engine has a sudden drop then with the help of the engine control unit the\r device sends a signal to the mobile application. In the mobile application we\r will already configure the emergency services contact numbers like ambulance,\rhospitals, police service and also main family members, When the device sends\r an alert to the mobile application it will give a message to all the saved\r contacts with the GPS location.\n\nIn addition to the above we will have a watch which detects the heartbeat, fall detection and blood pressure, We will upgrade the mobile application to the get an alert from the watch, If there is a sudden drop and more drop in the heartbeat and blood pressure then the mobile notifies the ambulance otherwise it just sends an alert to the family members."
